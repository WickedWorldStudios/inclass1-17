In class exercise, created new project with 3 files and then branched to modified-file, modified the contents of file2.txt, then pushed the new branch. Initial content was "hi", new content is 'Hi, I am now modified'.
UPDATE: I misread the instructions as change the content of 1 file instead of change the content of file 1
